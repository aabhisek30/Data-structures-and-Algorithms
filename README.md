# Data-structures-and-Algorithms

I have implemented Dynamic and Greedy algorithms 

## Dynamic programming

1. Assembly line scheduling
2. knapsack
3. Longest common subsequence
4. Matrix chain Multiplication

## Greedy programming

1. Fractional knapsack
2. Dijkstra algorithm
3. Making coin change
